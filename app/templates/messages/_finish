Craft is now installed!

You should add the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file so you can use Craft
locally free of licensing restrictions:

127.0.0.1 craft.dev

You should then be able to access the site at:
[http://craft.dev:8080/]

The admin portal is at:
[http://craft.dev:8080/admin]
User     : admin
Password : password

Finally, run `grunt watch` while working to get all of these perks:

* Sass/Compass auto-compile on save
* JSHint on save
* Browser auto-refresh on save

Before you move the code to staging or production, you should run `grunt build`
to generate minified versions of your CSS and Javascript.

Happy building!
